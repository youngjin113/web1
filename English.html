    <p>Eggs are <strong>a good source of <u>protein</u></strong>, and research has found that they may be good for your
        heart, eyes and brain. They also help you feel full. You can eat them with whole-grain bread to make a healthy
        breakfast. Try scrambled eggs on toast or a hard-boiled egg in a pita with vegetables.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:45 px;">Smoothies are a great breakfast if you don't have much time, or if you're not usually
        hungry
        in the morning. They're also easy to travel with if you want to have breakfast on the way to work.</p>
